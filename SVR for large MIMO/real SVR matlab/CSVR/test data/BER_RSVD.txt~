-----------------
this file record the simulation results of RSVD
this is the bit error rate of 32 X 32 MIMO system with 4 QAM modulation
the hyperparameters for RSVD are
test the epsilon and C
tolerence: 0.0010000000
without the clipper
the SNR are:
16 
the C are:
4 
the epsilon are:
1.000000e-07 
the symbol error rates are
